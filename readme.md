# ML_EPFL_project_1_final

Our code consists of 3 package .py files.

These contain general functions used throughout, help functions used in the six required implementations, and the implementations that give us our results:

- general_helpers.py
- implementations_helpers.py
- implementations.py

The results of the report, in sequential order, are found in the following python notebook, where we also included exploratory data analysis.

- report_code.ipynb

Finally, the run file that creates the best submission on Kaggle is:

- run.py
